I am a computational astrophysicist and machine learning enthusiast with a Ph.D. from Seoul National University. I have conducted postdoctoral research at the Flatiron Institute and Columbia University in New York. Currently, I am a SkAI fellow at the SkAI institute in Chicago. My scientific interests span galaxy formation, star clusters and black holes, machine learning, and computational astrophysics. I apply machine learning to cosmological simulations, leveraging the CAMELS suite to improve/calibrate galaxy formation models, and develop a hybrid hydrodynamic/direct N-body code (e.g., Enzoâ€‘Abyss) to study the evolution of star clusters within galaxies or a cosmological context. In addition to the academic work, I am also exploring the development of small language models.
